# awesome-semigroups
Awesome computationally efficient semigroups. At the moment this repository serves as a collection of useful semigroups I could use for hashing. See https://alexknvl.com/posts/monoidal-hashing.html for some background.

## Abelian groups
1. Addition on `Int`, `Long`, etc.
2. Multiplication on `Int`, `Long`, etc, excluding the zero.

## Non-commutative monoids with annihilators
1. `(a, b) |+| (c, d) = (a + b * c, b * d)`.

## Non-commutative monoids without annihilators
1. [Special linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_linear_group)
2. [General linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group)
