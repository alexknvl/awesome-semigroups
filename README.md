Awesome Semigroups. At the moment this repository serves as a collection of useful semigroups I could use for hashing.

## Abelian groups
1. Addition on N, Q, R, etc.
2. Multiplication on R \ {0} and other similar constructions.

## Non-commutative monoids with annihilators
1. (a, b) x (c, d) = (a + b * c, b * d)

## Non-commutative monoids without annihilators
1. [Special linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_linear_group)
2. [General linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group)
