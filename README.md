# awesome-semigroups
Awesome computationally efficient semigroups. At the moment this repository serves as a collection of useful semigroups I could use for hashing. See https://alexknvl.com/posts/monoidal-hashing.html for some background.

## Non-Commutative (Non-Abelian) Groups
1. [Special linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_linear_group)
2. [General linear group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_group)

## Commutative (Abelian) Groups
1. Addition on `Int`, `Long`, etc.
   * Can be mod `p` for any `p` as well.
2. Multiplication on `Int`, `Long`, etc, excluding the zero.
   * Can be mod `p` for any prime `p`.
3. Addition on matrices.
4. `x |+| y = x ^ y` (bit-wise xor).

## Commutative monoids with annihilators
1. `x |+| y = x & y` (bit-wise and).
2. `x |+| y = x | y` (bit-wise or).

## Commutative monoids without annihilators
1. `x |+| y = x * y + x + y`
   * `(0, 0)` is an identity element.
   * Can be mod `p` for any prime `p`.

## Non-commutative monoids with annihilators
1. `(a, b) |+| (c, d) = (a + b * c, b * d)`. 
   * `(0, 0)` is a left annihilator. 
   * `(0, 1)` is an identity element.
   * Can be mod `p` for any prime `p`.

## Non-commutative monoids without annihilators
1. `(a, b) |+| (c, d) = (a + b * c, b * d)` with `c` and `d` odd integers.
   * Can be mod `p` for any even number.
   * It might be a group? Hard to say.
2. `(a, b) |+| (c, d) = (a + (2 b + 1) c, 2 b d + b + d)`
   * Can be mod `p` for any number (?).
